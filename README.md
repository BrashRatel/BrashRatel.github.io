# ðŸ—²SplitðŸ—²TabðŸ—²

## Tool to split tabs/checks and invoice friends via lightning ##

This page was generated mostly with Claude AI with and quite a bit of steering and debugging from me. I had a need, so I figured I'd give it a shot. Feel free to submit a PR if you have any changes or improvments. **I have no idea what I'm doing!**ðŸ« 

### What does it do...? ###

It uses HTML CSS and Javascript to present a webpage that allows a user to enter in items/qnty/cost then split tabs and rearange items as necessary.
It also has some functionts that will contact a LNBits server and requrest invoices then present them inline with each tab.

I set it up under a github.pages with the demo LNbits server and a demo wallet I created, but you should easily be able to download the HTML and host it locally then change the LNBits info to your own. 

I even added a gear on the top right of the interface so then you can input/change the LNBits info on demand, and since the API key only lives in client memory (and isn't sent back to github) it's pretty safe to use in this hosted fashion.

### Harvest that ðŸŒ½ ###

If you like it let me know by sending me a tip! The default LNBits info of the page points to a demo wallet I setup. ðŸ˜ƒðŸ«´https://split.r00t.co
